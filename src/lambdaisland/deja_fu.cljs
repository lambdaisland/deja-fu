  "Time/Date types for use on the frontend. This provides the following
  equivalents:

  | #time/date \"2020-10-10\"                      | java.time.LocalDate     | goog.date.Date                 |
  | #time/time \"05:30:45\"                        | java.time.LocalTime     | lambdaisland.deja-fu/LocalTime |
  | #time/date-time \"2020-10-07T12:16:41.761088\" | java.time.LocalDateTime | goog.date.DateTime             |

  For all of these we make sure the tagged reader literals are read correctly,
  and that values of these types print with these reader tags.

  All times are \"local\", they don't carry timezone information.

  We also implement an ad-hoc API here, adding things as we need them, making
  sure that these functions hide the details of these types. All date/time
  manipulation on the frontend should go through this namespace. Avoid calling
  properties/methods of concrete types directly, and avoid using js/Date.

  Create a new local-date-time using the same syntax from goog.Date or js/Date:
    (local-date-time 2021 4 19 15 39 0 0)

  Parse a time string:
    (parse-local-date-time \"2021-01-01T23:59\")

  Get the current time:
    (local-date-time)

  Adjust the seconds component:
    (assoc (local-date-time) :seconds 0)

  Get the next day:
    (add-interval (local-date-time) {:hours 1})

  Works well with threading:
    (-> (parse-local-date-time \"2021-01-01T23:59\")
     (assoc :seconds 0)
     (to-local-date))"

The count of pattern letters determine the format.
- (Text) 4 or more, use full form, <4, use short or abbreviated form if it
exists. (e.g., \"EEEE\" produces \"Monday\", \"EEE\" produces \"Mon\")

- (Number) the minimum number of digits. Shorter numbers are zero-padded to
this amount (e.g. if \"m\" produces \"6\", \"mm\" produces \"06\"). Year is handled
specially; that is, if the count of 'y' is 2, the Year will be truncated to
2 digits. (e.g., if \"yyyy\" produces \"1997\", \"yy\" produces \"97\".) Unlike other
fields, fractional seconds are padded on the right with zero.

- (Text & Number) 3 or over, use text, otherwise use number. (e.g., \"M\"
produces \"1\", \"MM\" produces \"01\", \"MMM\" produces \"Jan\", and \"MMMM\" produces
\"January\".)

Any characters in the pattern that are not in the ranges of ['a'..'z'] and
['A'..'Z'] will be treated as quoted text. For instance, characters like ':',
'.', ' ', '#' and '@' will appear in the resulting time text even if they are
not inside single quotes."))
